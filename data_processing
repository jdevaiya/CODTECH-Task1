Data science is a complex field, as several related tasks are often performed under it. This includes data collection, mining, analytics, modeling, and reporting. Among these important tasks, one such task of making data usable is – Data Processing.
Data Processing is the task of converting data from a given form to a much more usable and desired form i.e. making it more meaningful and informative. 
Using Machine Learning algorithms, mathematical modeling, and statistical knowledge, this entire process can be automated. 
The output of this complete process can be in any desired form like graphs, videos, charts, tables, images, and many more, depending on the task we are performing and the requirements of the machine. 
This might seem to be simple but when it comes to massive organizations like Twitter, Facebook, Administrative bodies like Parliament, UNESCO, and health sector organizations, this entire process needs to be performed in a very structured manner. 
This process is known as data processing.  Data science professionals design systems in which raw data is the input, and the output is data that can produce actionable insights. 

Multiple types of data processing exist based on the data source and the steps taken by the data processing unit. It’s great that such multiple types of data processing exist, as one-size-fits-all methods have their problems.

The main steps involved in data processing typically include:

1.Data collection
2.Data preprocessing
3.Data analysis
4.Data interpretation
5.Data storage and management

1.Collection : 
The most crucial step when starting with ML is to have data of good quality and accuracy. Data can be collected from any authenticated source like data.gov.in, Kaggle or UCI dataset repository. For example, while preparing for a competitive exam, students study from the best study material that they can access so that they learn the best to obtain the best results. In the same way, high-quality and accurate data will make the learning process of the model easier and better and at the time of testing, the model would yield state-of-the-art results. 
A huge amount of capital, time and resources are consumed in collecting data. Organizations or researchers have to decide what kind of data they need to execute their tasks or research. 
Example: Working on the Facial Expression Recognizer, needs numerous images having a variety of human expressions. Good data ensures that the results of the model are valid and can be trusted upon. 
 
2.Preparation : 
The collected data can be in a raw form which can’t be directly fed to the machine. So, this is a process of collecting datasets from different sources, analyzing these datasets and then constructing a new dataset for further processing and exploration. This preparation can be performed either manually or from the automatic approach. Data can also be prepared in numeric forms also which would fasten the model’s learning. 
Example: An image can be converted to a matrix of N X N dimensions, the value of each cell will indicate the image pixel.
3.Input : 
Now the prepared data can be in the form that may not be machine-readable, so to convert this data to the readable form, some conversion algorithms are needed. For this task to be executed, high computation and accuracy is needed. Example: Data can be collected through the sources like MNIST Digit data(images), Twitter comments, audio files, video clips.
4.Processing : 
This is the stage where algorithms and ML techniques are required to perform the instructions provided over a large volume of data with accuracy and optimal computation.
Output : 
In this stage, results are procured by the machine in a meaningful manner which can be inferred easily by the user. Output can be in the form of reports, graphs, videos, etc
5.Storage : 
This is the final step in which the obtained output and the data model data and all the useful information are saved for future use.

You might be wondering why data processing is necessary. Although it can be time-consuming and sometimes requires data scientists to do it by hand or use special software, but the truth is, for any business that deals with data, processing it is essential.

Advantages of data processing in Machine Learning:
1.Improved model performance: Data processing helps improve the performance of the ML model by cleaning and transforming the data into a format that is suitable for modeling.
2.Better representation of the data: Data processing allows the data to be transformed into a format that better represents the underlying relationships and patterns in the data, making it easier for the ML model to learn from the data.
3.Increased accuracy: Data processing helps ensure that the data is accurate, consistent, and free of errors, which can help improve the accuracy of the ML model.

Disadvantages of data processing in Machine Learning:
1.Time-consuming: Data processing can be a time-consuming task, especially for large and complex datasets.
2.Error-prone: Data processing can be error-prone, as it involves transforming and cleaning the data, which can result in the loss of important information or the introduction of new errors.
3.Limited understanding of the data: Data processing can lead to a limited understanding of the data, as the transformed data may not be representative of the underlying relationships and patterns in the data.
